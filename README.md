# hello-world

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my site.

I'm Abina and I'm an actuary working in health & benefits consulting. I have 2.5 years of actuarial work experience, and currently hold the Associate of the Society of Actuaries (ASA) designation. I'm also actively working to achieve my FSA by 2023.

When I'm not working or studying, I am passionate about living a healthy and active lifestyle! I enjoy running, playing sports (especially tennis and spikeball!), and trying out new places to eat around San Francisco.
